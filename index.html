  <h1>💌 Love, they say, is both a flame and a mirror. A flame that burns away doubt, and a mirror that shows us who we truly are. And when I look at you, I see not just beauty, but the reflection of the life I want to live bold, mischievous, and endlessly profound.  

So here’s my rizz: skip the roses, skip the clichés. Let’s write our own philosophy of passion where kisses are arguments, touches are counterpoints, and every night is a thesis we never quite finish.  

Be my Valentine, not because the calendar says so, but because eternity feels too short without you.</h1>
